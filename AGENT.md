# AI Data Science Team Agents Overview

This repository develops an AI-powered data science team comprising specialized agents designed to automate and accelerate common data science tasks, from data cleaning and wrangling to machine learning model development and MLOps. It provides a modular and extensible framework for building agentic data science applications.

**Key Technologies/Frameworks:**
Python, LangChain, OpenAI (LLMs), Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, H2O, MLflow, SQLAlchemy, PyTimeTK, Missingno, Sweetviz.

**Main Features:**
Specialized agents for data wrangling, cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, SQL interaction, and data loading. Advanced agents for H2O-based machine learning and MLflow-driven MLOps. Multi-agent systems for comprehensive data analysis (e.g., Pandas and SQL data analysts). Interactive data science applications built with Streamlit.

**Architectural Patterns:**
Multi-agent architecture with discrete, specialized agents collaborating on complex tasks. Modular design promoting extensibility and reusability. LLM orchestration for agent communication and workflow management. Tool-use paradigm where agents leverage specific data science libraries and tools.
